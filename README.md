## Overview

This project, named "User Management," is a robust Spring Boot application designed for managing user data efficiently. It provides a set of RESTful API endpoints that allow you to perform various operations on user records, such as adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting user information. 

## Technologies Used

- **Framework:** Spring Boot
- **Language:** Java
- **Build Tool:** Maven

## Data Flow

### Controller

The Controller layer is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and delegating them to the appropriate services. It defines API endpoints for the following operations:

1. **Add User:** `POST /user`
2. **Add Users:** `POST /users`
3. **Get All Users:** `GET /users`
4. **Get User by ID:** `GET /user/{userID}`
5. **Update User Phone Number:** `PUT /user/{userID}/number/{phoneNumber}`
6. **Update User Address:** `PUT /user/{userID}/address/{email}`
7. **Delete User by ID:** `DELETE /user/{userID}`

```java
@RestController
@Validated
public class UserController {
    @Autowired
    UserService userService;

    // Add a user
    @PostMapping("user")
    public String addUser(@Valid @RequestBody User user) {
        return userService.inputUser(user);
    }

    // Get all users
    @GetMapping("users")
    public List<User> getAllUsers() {
        return userService.getAllUser();
    }

    // ...
}
```

## Services

The Services layer implements the core business logic, data processing, and interaction with the data repository. Key responsibilities include:

- Validating input data.
- Performing CRUD operations on user data.
- Handling data transformations and interactions with external systems (if applicable).

```java
@Service
public class UserService {
    @Autowired
    UserRepo userRepo;

    public List<User> getAllUser() {
        return userRepo.getUsers();
    }

    // ...
}
```

## Repository

The Repository layer manages data access to the underlying database. It handles database operations such as Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) for user data. Additionally, it may include data mapping and conversion between Java objects and database entities.

```java
@Repository
public class UserRepo {
    @Autowired
    private List<User> userList;

    public List<User> getUsers() {
        return userList;
    }

    // ...
}
```


## Database Design

The project's database design includes tables for user management, with fields such as:

- `userId` (User ID)
- `userName` (User Name)
- `type` (User Type)
- `userEmail` (Email Address)
- `userContactNo` (Phone Number)
- `dob` (Date of Birth)
- Timestamps for record creation and modification

### User Table

| Column Name    | Data Type      | Description                        |
| -------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| userId         | INT            | Unique identifier for each user    |
| userName       | VARCHAR(255)   | User's full name                   |
| type           | ENUM           | User type (ADMIN, INTERNAL, EXTERNAL) |
| userEmail      | VARCHAR(255)   | User's email address               |
| userContactNo  | VARCHAR(12)    | User's phone number (e.g., 911234567890) |
| dob            | DATE           | User's date of birth               |
| created_at     | TIMESTAMP      | Timestamp of record creation       |
| updated_at     | TIMESTAMP      | Timestamp of record modification   |

The "User" table stores user-related information, including user IDs, names, types, contact information, date of birth, and timestamps for record creation and modification.

This database design ensures data integrity and provides a structured approach to managing user information within the application.


## Data Structures Used

The project utilizes the following data structures:

### User Class

The `User` class defines the structure for user data and includes the following fields:

- `userId` (User ID): An integer that serves as a unique identifier for each user.
- `userName` (User Name): A string representing the user's full name.
- `type` (User Type): An enumeration specifying the user type, including ADMIN, INTERNAL, and EXTERNAL.
- `userEmail` (Email Address): A string containing the user's email address.
- `userContactNo` (Phone Number): A string representing the user's phone number (e.g., 911234567890).
- `dob` (Date of Birth): A date field indicating the user's date of birth.
- Timestamps for record creation and modification.

### Type Enum

The `Type` enum enumerates the possible user types:

- `ADMIN`: Represents an administrator user.
- `INTERNAL`: Represents an internal user.
- `EXTERNAL`: Represents an external user.

### ArrayList

The project utilizes the `ArrayList` data structure to store and manage lists of `User` objects in various parts of the application. `ArrayList` provides dynamic sizing and efficient element retrieval, making it suitable for storing user records and performing operations on them.

These data structures enable the application to organize and manipulate user data efficiently while maintaining data integrity.


## Project Summary
